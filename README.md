# Walker_Faller_Detection-using-ML-models
Fall incidents among elderly individuals and patients with limited mobility who rely on orthopedic walkers pose a significant risk to their safety and well-being. 

The Dataset for the project is taken from Kaggle
The actual data is taken from the sensors on orthopedic walkers, wearable devices, and a combination of sources.

We used three ML_models, Random forests, Extra trees and SVM. 

In this machine learning project, our goal was to develop an accurate, economical, and reliable solution for fall detection in individuals relying on orthopedic walkers. The primary focus was on enhancing the safety and well-being of elderly individuals and patients with limited mobility.

Considering the accuracies of the 3 models we used, Random Forest gives the highest accuracy. Given its consistently high performance and adaptability, Random Forest stands as the preferred choice for the implementation of an accurate, economical, and reliable fall detection system for individuals relying on orthopedic walkers.
